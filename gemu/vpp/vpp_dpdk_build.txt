Overview
The goal is to build DPDK which is an external package for VPP together with debug symbols to be able to debug inside DPDK source code.

Version

VPP version is 23.02

Configuration
We need to modify two files:

build/external/deb/debian/rules
build/external/packages/dpdk.mk

<dpdk.mk>
The following flag has to be enabled.

DPDK_DEBUG ?= y

<rules>
The following lines have to be added.

override_dh_strip:
dh_strip --exclude=librte

<Rebuild>
 
sudo dpkg -r vpp-ext-deps
make install-ext-dep
make rebuild
gdb

When running gdb we need to specify the path to DPDK sources.

set substitute-path '../src-dpdk/' 
'/home/projects/vpp/build/external/downloads/dpdk-22.07'
